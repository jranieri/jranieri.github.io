<p>I am the first (and most likely last) tech transfer officer of the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory (<a href='http://lcav.epfl.ch'>LCAV</a>) at <a href='http://www.epfl.ch'>EPFL</a> lead by <a href='http://lcav.epfl.ch/martin.vetterli'>Martin Vetterli</a> (a great engineer and an even greater guy). I am responsible of filing some patents, writing research grant, supervise some good students and keep my research going. At the end of the day, my job is a postdoctoral position that is more focused on the tech transfer aspects.</p>

<p>Before that, I was a PhD student (supervised by the Martin Vetterli and <a href='http://lcav.epfl.ch/people/chebira'>Amina Chebira</a>) in the same lab and I graduated with a thesis titled "Sensing the real world: inverse problems, sparsity and sensor placement" (<a href='http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/201739?ln=en'>Get your own copy here!</a>). If you are interested in my research, check the research tab: you can find (or you will find asap) code, data, papers, posters and so on.</p>

<p>At the beginning of my research career, there was a bachelor and a master in Electronic Engineering from <a href='http://www.unibo.it'>Universit√° di Bologna<a/>. </p>

<p> Beside research... </p>
