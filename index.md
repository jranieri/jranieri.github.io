Welcome to my personal webpage. At the moment is pretty empty, but I am strongly motivated in having this website finished and active by the end of the summer 2015. 

What will I focus on?

*  	Blog articles about things I am currently doing, or that I am looked into in the past or that I will love to do in the near future.
*   Present all my research results, since the beginning of my PhD. I want them to be reproducible by anyone (i.e. data, code and instructions available) and potentially understandable by everyone(i.e. writing small essays describing the topics to non-practitioners)
* 	Post galleries with a selection of my favourite photos that I shot around the world. 

Indeed, quite a soup. Hopefully, it will be juicy and inspiring. 

Last, I would love to write articles explaining topics in data science I am familiar with, targeting anyone who never heard of data science before. If you have any request, please drop me an <a href="mailto:juri.ranieri@gmail.com" target="_top">e-mail</a>.
