This page contains my research projects, my papers (together with the code to reproduce results and figures), slides of my talks and the PDFs of the posters I present at conferences. The material is organized by research topic.


### Sparse phase retrieval (2011-still ongoing)
*Joint work with M. Vetterli, A. Chebira*

TO BE COMPLETED


### Sensor placement (2011-2014)
*Joint work with M. Vetterli, D. Atienza, A. Chebira, Z. Chen, R. Zhang, A. Vincenzi*


Assume we deploy a sensor network and we can choose the position of the nodes from a set of possible locations. We would like to optimize the sensor locations such that we minimize the reconstruction error when solving a given inverse problem. Choosing the sensor locations under such constraints is a combinatorial problem and only a brute force approach can find the optimal solution in polynomial time. 

Our contributions are:

1. **A near-optimal algorithm for the sensor placement for linear inverse problems**. We discuss our result in [this paper](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/196527) and the code to reproduce the figures of the paper is available [here](https://github.com/jranieri/OptimalSensorPlacement). In sum, the paper introduces the prolem, presents a greedy algorithm based on the frame potential (a cost function used in[ frame theory](https://www.google.ch/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#)) and proves that such an algorithm is theoretically near-optimal. We corroborate our results with numerical experiments on random and real-world linear inverse problems. 
An extension of this work to union-of-subspaces has been presented at [EUSIPCO 2014](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/198239?ln=en).

2. **A state-of-the-art method for the thermal monitoring of many-core microprocessors**.

3. **A state-of-the-art method for the adaptive sampling scheduling of sensor network**.
