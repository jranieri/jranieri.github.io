The target of this page is to make all my research results reproducible, all my talks, poster and papers available, and possibly foster future research. The material is organized by research topic.




### Sensor placement for linear inverse problems ###
*Joint work with M. Vetterli, D. Atienza, A. Chebira, Z. Chen, R. Zhang, A. Vincenzi*


Assume we deploy a sensor network and we can choose the position of the nodes from a set of possible locations. We would like to optimize the sensor locations such that we minimize the reconstruction error when solving a given inverse problem. Choosing the sensor locations under such constraints is a combinatorial problem and only a brute force approach can find the optimal solution in polynomial time. 

Our contributions are:

1. **A near-optimal algorithm for the sensor placement for linear inverse problems**. We discuss our result in [this paper](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/196527) and the code to reproduce the figure of the paper is available [here](https://github.com/jranieri/OptimalSensorPlacement). In sum, we discuss the problem, we design a greedy algorithm based on the frame potential (a cost function used in[ frame theory](https://www.google.ch/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#)) and we show that such an algorithm is theoretically near-optimal. We corroborate our results with numerical experiments on random and real-world matrices.

2. **A state-of-the-art method for the thermal monitoring of many-core microprocessors**.

3. **A state-of-the-art method for the adaptive sampling scheduling of sensor network**.
