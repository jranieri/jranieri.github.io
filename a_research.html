The target of this page is to make all my research results reproducible, all my talks, poster and papers available, and possibly foster future research. The material is organized by research topic.

<h4> Sensor placement for linear inverse problems </h4>

*Joint work with M. Vetterli, D. Atienza, A. Chebira, Z. Chen, R. Zhang, A. Vincenzi*

</br>


Assume we deploy a sensor network and we can choose the position of the nodes from a set of possible locations. We would like to optimize the sensor locations such that the solution of a given linear inverse problem has a minimum amount of error. Choosing the sensor locations under such constraints is a combinatorial problem and only a brute force approach can find the optimal solution in polynomial time. 

Our contributions are:

	1. A near-optimal algorithm 
	2. 
	3.
