Today, it was my turn at the group meetings (we call them TAM, Tuesday afternoon meeting, even if now they are on Mondays) and I decided to give a completely non-scientific talk: a set of advices for the younger students, from day-to-day practices to job hunting (mostly concentrated on job in the industry). 

I guess that most of the advices are trivial, but I feel that repeating them once more could be beneficial. Here you can see the slides!
